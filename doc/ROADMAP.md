# Roadmap – Seej

> This roadmap describes the **major construction steps** of the platform.  
> It is **neither exhaustive nor contractual**, and may evolve according to governance decisions.

## Navigation

- [`README.md`](../README.md)
- [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md)

- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)
- [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

The project's absolute priority is the **solidity of the simulation core**, its **maintainability**, and its **long-term sustainability**.

---

## Phase 0 – Conceptual Foundations (Completed)

Status: Done

Phase 0 locked the project's long-term invariants and governance model.
Its objective was to establish clear, defensible foundations before scaling implementation.

Delivered:
- Vision and fundamental principles documented
- Explicit definition of what the project **is** and **is not**
- Formal separation between:
  - simulation core
  - optional modules
  - clients
- Foundational documentation:
  - README
  - CONTRIBUTING
  - Code of Conduct
  - architecture and decision documents

Phase 0 remains the reference baseline for all future decisions.

## Phase 1 – Minimal Simulation Core (Server Only)

Status: Implemented; closure evidence tracked in `seej/docs/phase1/EXIT_CHECKLIST.md`

🎯 **Single (exclusive) objective**

Prove that a simulated world can exist, evolve, and persist with **no client, no player, and no graphical interface**.

This phase explicitly does **not** target:
- feature richness
- performance
- advanced extensibility
- user experience

It aims to make the world's autonomous existence undeniable.

Guiding principle

If the server can run alone for hours, is killed abruptly, restarts, and the world continues as if nothing happened, then Phase 1 is validated.

Anything that does not directly serve this proof is out of scope.

✅ **Mandatory capabilities (strict scope)**

1. **Deterministic simulation loop**
   - Explicit tick execution
   - Strictly controlled execution order
   - No implicit dependencies:
     - no direct system clock access
     - no non-injected RNG
   - Same inputs ⇒ same outputs

Determinism is a functional requirement, not an optimization.

2. **Persistent simulated time**
   - World time is simulated data
   - It progresses independently of any human presence
   - It is explicitly stored and restored on restart
   - No dependency on real time

3. **Minimal spatial representation**
   - A structured space exists (zones / regions / chunks — free form)
   - Space is persistent
   - Space can be partially loaded / simulated
   - No realism or spatial optimization goals

   Space may be abstract. It only needs to exist.

4. **Persistent non-player entities**
   - Entities have:
     - stable identity
     - internal state
     - lifecycle
   - They exist without players, evolve via simple systemic rules, and survive restarts

   No "player" entities. No exceptions.

5. **Minimal systemic rules**
   - At least one causal rule exists (e.g., consumption, degradation, transformation, movement)
   - It produces observable state changes
   - It depends only on the simulation
   - No gameplay or balancing goals

   A single rule is enough if it is real and persistent.

6. **Explicit on-disk persistence**
   - Every world mutation is explicitly written to disk and traceable
   - The world must never vanish when the server stops
   - No reliance on implicit in-memory state

   Persistence is critical.

7. **Recovery after stop or crash**
   - The server may be killed abruptly and restarted
   - The world is automatically restored, coherent, and requires no human intervention

   A lost world = Phase 1 failure.

8. **Headless server execution**
   - No graphical interface
   - No dependency on any rendering engine
   - No connected client required
   - “Solo” = local server; “Multi” = the same server, remote

Minimal observability required

The world must be observable without a UI. Acceptable means:
- structured logs
- state dumps
- basic CLI tools
- diagnostic files

No graphical visualization is required.

Explicit out of scope (forbidden in Phase 1)

Formally excluded:
- any graphical client
- any UI (even advanced debug UI)
- any player-oriented logic
- optional modules
- advanced AI
- complex economy
- advanced networking
- CPU/memory optimization
- parallelism
- balancing or “fun”
- graphics standards
- stabilized public API

Introducing any of these too early invalidates Phase 1 scope discipline.

Validation criteria (measurable)

Phase 1 is complete only if:
- the server can run alone indefinitely
- the world evolves without human interaction
- a restart destroys nothing
- two runs with the same inputs produce the same world
- the server has zero graphical dependencies

Phase 1 implementation status (current repository)

Already implemented:
- Deterministic tick loop with mandatory seed at world creation
- Persistent simulated time (`Tick`, `SimTime`) in world state
- Persistent zones and entities with stable identifiers
- Snapshot + WAL persistence with event cursor (`last_event_id`)
- Crash recovery by loading snapshot and replaying WAL
- Headless daemon (`server_d`) for create/list/run flows
- Inspection CLI (`sy_cli`) for status, events, entities, zones, dumps
- Determinism tooling and tests (canonical hashing and replay checks)

Closure evidence tracked separately:
- Fast local gates cover formatting, tests, clippy, replay strictness, WAL recovery, and dependency drift.
- Scheduled/manual ignored gates cover forced-kill recovery and long burn-in runs.
- The authoritative closure checklist is `seej/docs/phase1/EXIT_CHECKLIST.md`.

Final rule (non-negotiable)

Phase 1 is not meant to be impressive. It is meant to be irrefutable.

Anything that does not help prove the world's autonomous, persistent existence does not belong here.

## Phase 2 – Modular Architecture and Public APIs

🎯 **Objective: Enable extension without weakening the core**

Once the minimal core is stable, the focus shifts to controlled extensibility.

Main axes:
- Definition of versioned public APIs
- Optional module system
- Module loading / activation / deactivation
- Strict isolation between core and extensions
- Compatibility and versioning management
- Documentation of core invariants

This phase is critical to:
- avoid feature creep
- guarantee project longevity
- enable healthy community contribution

---

## Phase 3 – Advanced Simulation and Scalability

🎯 **Objective: A credible world at large scale**

The world must be able to:
- grow
- become more complex
- survive over time

Work axes:
- Simulation by regions with detail levels
- CPU / memory optimization
- Management of large numbers of entities
- Systemic events (economy, shortages, migrations, conflicts)
- Replay and deterministic validation tools
- Advanced observability (metrics, diagnostics)

The focus remains **systemic**, never game-oriented.

---

## Phase 4 – Reference Client (Unreal Engine)

🎯 **Objective: Visualize the world, not define it**

An official client based on Unreal Engine is introduced as:
- reference implementation
- technical showcase
- visual validation tool

Characteristics:
- Strict consumer of server state
- No critical calculations on the client side
- Modern but sober rendering
- Documented graphics standard
- Coherent and extensible asset pipeline

The client **never drives** world evolution.

---

## Phase 5 – Tools, SDK, and Community Opening

🎯 **Objective: Make the project a true platform**

Final structuring phase before maturity:

- SDK for module developers
- Tools for administering persistent worlds
- Advanced documentation (guides, diagrams, examples)
- Server templates
- Expanded community governance
- Stabilized contribution process

The project then becomes a **reusable infrastructure**, independent of any official content.

---

## Out of Scope

This roadmap **does not include**:
- "fun-first" gameplay
- player balancing
- written narration
- quests
- cinematics
- default content
- monetization
- marketing promises

These elements belong to **worlds created from the platform**, not to the platform itself.

---

## Guiding Principle

Each step is validated by a single question:

> **Can the world exist, evolve, and persist without a player or client?**

If the answer is no, the foundation is not yet sufficient.
